Summary
Computer Science student passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Space Tech and Quantitative Finance. Experience
in building AI-driven applications that integrate NLP, deep learning, and financial modeling. Skilled in data pipelines, research-based
automation, and visualization.
Research Interests
Machine learning applications in physical and space sciences, with a focus on characterizing interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations using
cosmic ray secondaries (muons). Deep learning architectures including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs)
for modeling complex, high-dimensional physical systems. Bayesian inference for probabilistic modeling and uncertainty quantification.
Reinforcement learning optimization algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), with interest in their mathematical foundations and large-scale training dynamics as explored in recent DeepSeek math and reasoning
research.

Projects
Fraud Click Detection System Link
Developed an end-to-end fraud click detection system using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
Implemented ensemble learning with hard and soft voting to improve robustness on imbalanced clickstream data. Built an interactive
Streamlit dashboard for real-time hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curves, confusion
matrices, and feature importance analysis.
Resume Insight Analyzer Link
Built an AI-powered Streamlit app using Sentence Transformers and SpaCy to analyze resumes, identify skill gaps, and evaluate tone
using semantic similarity and sentiment scoring.
Financial Analysis and Stock Prediction App Link
Developed a predictive stock analytics system with Yahoo Finance, Finnhub API, Prophet, and XGBoost for real-time visualization
and sentiment-based market insights.
Real-Time Emotion Detection Link
Implemented a webcam-based facial emotion recognition system using OpenCV and FER for real-time classification of human emotions.
Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation Link
Simulated probabilistic stock price movements using Monte Carlo methods with Streamlit, NumPy, and yFinance for interactive
financial forecasting.
